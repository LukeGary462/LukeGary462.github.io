## C Tip Number 1

## The Problem ##
When I am writing C software, typically it is for some embedded system.
_Most_ of the projects I have worked on are either bare metal on small
 microcontrollers (PIC, AVR, MSP430, Cortex-Mx, etc), or using some real-time
 operating system such as FreeRTOS, ChibiOS, or something home grown. For one reason or another, many times custom drivers and hardware abstractions are often necessary, which can be a total pain in the ass since you end up with 50% of your time or more being spent on boiler plate code.
